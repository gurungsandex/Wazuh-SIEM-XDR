# wazuhProject

A home-lab project showing how to install **Wazuh** (manager + dashboard) on an Ubuntu server and how to enroll agents on other VMs.  
This guide helps build a realistic, SOC-style lab at home or in VMs.

I am trying to make this project as simple as possible!

## Lab goal
Install a single-node Wazuh central stack (manager + indexer + dashboard) on one Ubuntu VM and enroll 1â€“3 agents on other VMs (Ubuntu/Windows). Keep everything simple and reproducible.
