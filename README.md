# WazuhProject  
This home-lab project helps build a realistic, SOC-style lab at home or in VMs.  
This home lab project demonstrates how to host a **Wazuh Server** on an Ubuntu server and how to enroll agents on other machines/VMs.  

I want to make this project as simple as possible!

## ✅ Advantages of this project
- 💰 Free of cost  
- 🖥️ Easy to learn & implement  
- 🚀 Beginner-friendly

## 🔹 What is Wazuh? 
Wazuh is an **open-source security monitoring platform (SIEM + XDR)** that provides:  
- Agent-based endpoint monitoring  
- Log analysis & alerting  
- File integrity monitoring (FIM)  
- Vulnerability detection  
- Threat detection & response  

It’s widely used in security operations centers (SOCs) for real-time visibility and defense.  

---

## 🔹 Project Expectation
In this project, I will:  
1. Install **Wazuh Server** on an Ubuntu Server VM.  
2. Deploy a **Wazuh Agent** on a Kali Linux VM.  
3. Connect the agent to the server and verify successful enrollment.  
4. Demonstrate alerts to confirm communication between server and agent(s).  

---

## 🔹 Lab Environment (VirtualBox on macOS)
- **Host machine**: MacBook (running VirtualBox)  
- **VM 1**: Ubuntu Server → Wazuh Server  
- **VM 2**: Kali Linux → Wazuh Agent

## 🛠️ Wazuh Server Installation on Ubuntu Server
**Step 1**: Update packages and run the Wazuh installer:  
            
            sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
            
            curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.13/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
            
Step 2: After installation, it will generate a username and password to access Wazuh server dashboard.

Step 3: Find the server IP address of Ubuntu server (Wazuh server is hosted on Ubuntu), and use this IP to access the Wazuh dashboard in the browser.

Step 4: Login with the generated username and password to verify the dashboard is working.

## 🖥️ Wazuh Agent Deployment on Kali Linux
Step 1: From the Wazuh Dashboard, go to:
👉 Deploy new agent
Select agent OS type = Kali Linux (Debian-based)
Server address = Ubuntu server IP address.
It will generate commands to deploy agent.

Step 2: Run the commands on Kali terminal

Step 3: Check the Wazuh Dashboard to confirm the agent is enrolled and shows status active.

## Playing with Alerts
## Privilege Escalation Demo

In this demo, I’ll show how Wazuh detects failed privilege-escalation attempts (wrong sudo password) and how those events travel from the agent to the server. This is a simple way to prove the agent ↔ server communication chain.
1. On the Kali agent, I intentionally entered the wrong sudo password several times to trigger authentication failures.

2. These failed attempts show up in the Wazuh alerts, proving the agent is successfully reporting to the server.

## File Integrity Monitoring
In this demo, I will show how changes made on the agent are detected by Wazuh server, proving agent → server communication.
1. Edit the agent’s configuration file: /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf. In the "File Integrity Monitoring" section of ossec.conf file, enable the alerting/monitoring for the paths you want to watch (e.g., /root, /etc/hosts).

            sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
   
<img width="992" height="245" alt="file integrity 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1271ade0-8608-4ecc-a106-0b627c6cc168" />

2. After editing, save the file and restart the agent so the new FIM settings take effect.
   
            sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent

3. Now, on the monitored machine, create and remove files (or edit files) in the monitored path to generate FIM events.

4. Now, view alerts on the Wazuh server. The alerts should be shown for the file creations/deletions performed.

## 📌 Project Outcome

✅ Wazuh Server running on Ubuntu VM

✅ Kali Linux agent enrolled successfully

✅ Communication verified through alerts


This gives a working mini SOC home lab!



## 🚀 Next Steps

Add more alert demonstrations 

Add more agents (Windows, other Linux VMs)

Create custom detection rules
